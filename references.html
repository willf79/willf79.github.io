  <p>"Willem was a perfect fit for Cambridge Semantics super smart, very technical, and results oriented culture. I worked with him during his internship as a team leader in the Field Ops group where he drove the effort to build a custom demo that mapped complex healthcare data against an industry standard model to track patient journeys. Willem rapidly mastered CSI’s data integration and modeling tool Anzo – which is based on graph data models - before quickly moving on to tackling the more difficult and uncharted tasks of defining data transformation and mapping processes to align the data to the model. Willem showed an exceptional ability to creatively solve complex technical problems, while also working closely with other engineers and our healthcare vertical expert to understand the best way to use the platform and envision the ideal final demo experience. His expertise with data modeling and analytic concepts and proficiency with programming languages like Python and R, combined with his inherent drive and creativity made him a valuable and high impact part of our team during his internship."</p>

  <p>"Willem Fargo joined my team within Cambridge Semantics on June 8. His role upon hire was as an intern in Field Operations, which is the professional services arm of our company. His role was to assist in the demonstration and adoption of Anzo, our data fabric tool that uses graph and semantic technology to enable data science and analytics activities in data discovery and integration.</p>

  <p>Willem's internship began with a broad overview of Anzo's features and capabilities, in which he drew together a compelling use-case of looking at law enforcement actvities across different locales to offer insight into the present political climate. He was then chosen for a select team to develop a collateral demonstration of Anzo's use in healthcare data. In this effort, he has harmonized patient data to an industry-standard data model meant for data interoperability, and he has made it easy to aggregate and review the patient journey for individuals whose data is onboarded into the system, illustrating how Anzo can facilitate activities from monitoring to diagnosis to long-term care.</p>

  <p>Willem has proven his ability to learn new technologies quickly, to work with domain experts, to present his progress and findings to senior audiences, and to respond to and incorporate feedback readily and constructively. He has established professional value in the fields of data science and analytics, and I look forward to seeing how he matures as he continues his studies in information science and his professional exposure in the software industry."</p>
